Hello there,

This project is very special to me.  
I originally created this web for someone important in my life, and every part of the code carries that meaning.  
If you’re looking through these files, I hope you’ll appreciate the effort and purpose behind them.

-----------------------------------------
About This Project
-----------------------------------------
Each file has its own role in making the website work.  
I’ve written notes so you can understand what each file is for.

File Guide

## Project Structure

- **index.html**  
  The main webpage. This is the first page that loads when someone visits the site.

- **style.css**  
  Controls the design, layout, colours, and styles of the webpage.

- **script.js**  
  Adds interactivity and logic to the webpage (animations, buttons, events, etc).

- **ttd.png**  
  A signature image used in the site.

- **/audio/**  
  Contains audio files used in the project.

(You can add/change the content, but please keep the structure clear.)

Notes
-----------------------------------------
- This web was built with personal meaning, but you’re free to adapt it.  
- Please respect the spirit in which it was created.  
- If you change it, make it yours — but remember where it started.

Author’s Note
-----------------------------------------
This code is more than just lines and files.  
It’s a part of my thoughts, my time, and a dedication.  
If you use it, I hope you’ll take a moment to appreciate it, even if you make it into something completely different.
